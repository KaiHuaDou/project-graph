**Draw fast, think efficiently** — Unleash creativity and streamline workflows with AI-powered graph design.

## 🚀 Features

- **Blazing-Fast Drawing**
  Create complex node diagrams in seconds with drag-and-drop simplicity. Optimized with Tauri framework for seamless performance, even with thousands of nodes.

- **AI-Powered Intelligence**
  Auto-generate tree structures and suggest node relationships using integrated large language models (e.g., ChatGPT), accelerating brainstorming and system design.

- **Dynamic Compute Engine**
  Analyze dependencies, optimize paths, and derive logic trees in real time through a powerful graph engine.

- **Cross-Platform & Multi-Modal**
  Native support for Windows, Linux, and experimental macOS/Android builds. Export diagrams as PNG, SVG, or JSON for diverse use cases.

- **Open Ecosystem**
  Built with React and ~~extensible APIs~~ (WIP). MIT-licensed for unlimited customization.
