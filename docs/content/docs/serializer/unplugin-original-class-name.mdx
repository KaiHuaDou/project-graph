If you enabled `minify` or similar options in your build tool config, you cannot get the name of a class in compiled code.

For example, you may get compiled code like this:

```js
class A(e,t){this.name=e,this.age=t,this.isGreeting=!1}
```

In this case, the original class name `Person` is lost.

To solve this problem, we can use the `unplugin-original-class-name` plugin. This plugin will add a static property `className` to each class.

For more information, see the [unplugin-original-class-name documentation](/docs/unplugin-original-class-name).
